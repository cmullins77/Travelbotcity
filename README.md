To Run Bot:

Open Command Line at folder
    npm i twit
    node bot.js

The bot should immediatly tweet the previously saved message and then save a new one.
Periodically (every 30 minutes) it will tweet the previously prepared message and create another.
To quickly make a few tweets just run the command (node bot.js), wait for "done" to be printed out, stop the program, and repeat.
